# BIO3092 Variant Calling Workshop

In this workshop, you are going to compute variant sites from your genome alignments, as well as create a small Perl script to count the number of SNPs and reference sites are in your VCFs. To recap, you will be studying 12 isolates belonging to fungal pathogen C. gattii. You should have 12 sorted BAM files from Workshop 2 alignments. If not, you will find brief notes at the start of this workshop on how to remake them.
